## Context
Duke + Dexter required a UI and UX rework of some key pages (namely PLP and PDP) to really showcase the bespoke nature of their products.

## Solution
Addressing the UX of the PLP and PDP pages was the first item on the agenda. Adding the ability to filter products by colour, material, type, and size on the PLP was key in allowing customers to more easily narrow down their search. We also added the ability to sort the items so they could see the newest stock, or the featured items.

After that we added the ability for a user to see what sizes a product was available just by hovering on the product card. This greatly improves the UX for the customer as they don't have to click through to the PDP to see this information, which in turn decreases user dropoff.

Then we addressed the UX of the PDP pages by making the colour and size pickers much more prominent and frendlier to use than before.

Adding product images of people wearing the products throughout the PLP served as a nice visually pleasing break to a wall of product listings. It also allows the customer to see what the product will look like in person.

Finally we made some big changes to the UI of the PDP pages. Firstly increasing the prominence of the product images was key on an ecommerce site, then we added a much more premium feel to the product information, and we made everything work much better responsively.
